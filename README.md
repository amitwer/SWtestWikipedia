# SWtestWikipedia

There's only one rule when editing and contributing - be kind. 
Being kind in this context is listening to what people say and write, and dicuss disagreements respectfully (the slack channel should be great for such discussions). Feel free to add as much stuff as you want, but when removing or drastically changing something another person wrote, please have a short discussion with that person. 
Also, when commiting, try to sum what you did in a few words, try to avoid committing without a decent comment.
